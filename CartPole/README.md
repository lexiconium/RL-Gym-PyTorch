## Speicification [2]

### Description

This environment corresponds to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson
in ["Neuronlike Adaptive Elements That Can Solve Difficult Learning Control Problem"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6313077)
. A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum starts
upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over by increasing and reducing the cart's velocity.

### Action Space

The agent take a 1-element vector for actions. The action space is `(action)` in `[0, 1]`, where `action` is used to
push the cart with a fixed amount of force:

| Num | Action                 |
|-----|------------------------|
| 0   | Push cart to the left  |
| 1   | Push cart to the right |

**Note**: The amount the velocity is reduced or increased is not fixed as it depends on the angle the pole is pointing. This
is because the center of gravity of the pole increases the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it

### Observation Space

The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(4,)` where the elements correspond to the following:

| Num | Observation           | Min                  | Max                |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 0   | Cart Position         | -4.8*                 | 4.8*                |
| 1   | Cart Velocity         | -Inf                 | Inf                |
| 2   | Pole Angle            | ~ -0.418 rad (-24°)** | ~ 0.418 rad (24°)** |
| 3   | Pole Angular Velocity | -Inf                 | Inf                |

**Note**: above denotes the ranges of possible observations for each element, but in two cases this range exceeds the
range of possible values in an un-terminated episode:

- `*`: the cart x-position can be observed between `(-4.8, 4.8)`, but an episode terminates if the cart leaves the
  `(-2.4, 2.4)` range.
- `**`: Similarly, the pole angle can be observed between  `(-.418, .418)` radians or precisely **±24°**, but an episode
  is terminated if the pole angle is outside the `(-.2095, .2095)` range or precisely **±12°**

### Rewards

Reward is 1 for every step taken, including the termination step. The threshold is 475 for v1.

### Starting State

All observations are assigned a uniform random value between (-0.05, 0.05)

### Episode Termination

The episode terminates of one of the following occurs:

1. Pole Angle is more than ±12°
2. Cart Position is more than ±2.4 (center of the cart reaches the edge of the display)
3. Episode length is greater than 500 (200 for v0)
