# RL-Gym-PyTorch

The purpose of this repository is to write Reinforcement Learning algorithms in codes
and test those with various OpenAI Gym environments.

One of the purposes was to show the entire structure of the algorithm as clearly as possible (at least to my perspective)
generalization of algorithms is ignored and thus all algorithms are bound to each specific environment.


## Environments

Each directory contains:
- Overview and Specifications of the environment
- Algorithms*

`*`: Includes pseudocode, code and result

### Available
- [CartPole-v1](https://github.com/lexiconium/RL-Gym-PyTorch/tree/main/CartPole)
