# RL-Gym-PyTorch

The purpose of this repository is to implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms in PyTorch and test them on a variety of OpenAI Gym environments.

All implementations are specific to each environment with minimum generalization so that the entire structure of the algorithm can be seen as clearly as possible.

## Environments

Each directory contains:
- Overview and Specifications of the environment
- Algorithms*

`*`: Includes pseudocode, code and result
