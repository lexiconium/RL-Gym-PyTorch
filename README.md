# RL-Gym-PyTorch

The purpose of this repository is to implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms in PyTorch
and test those with various OpenAI Gym environments.

One of the purposes was to show the entire structure of the algorithm as clearly as possible (at least to my perspective)
thus all implementations are bound to each specific environment with minimum generalization.


## Environments

Each directory contains:
- Overview and Specifications of the environment
- Algorithms*

`*`: Includes pseudocode, code and result

### Available
- [CartPole-v1](https://github.com/lexiconium/RL-Gym-PyTorch/tree/main/CartPole)
